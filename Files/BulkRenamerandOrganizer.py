# This program will take a series of files and renames them with a specific filename filter entered by the user.
#For instance if the user enters myimage###.jpg it will rename all files with a minimum of three numbers like myimage001.jpg, myimage145.jpg or even myimage1987.jpg since 1987 has at least three numbers.
