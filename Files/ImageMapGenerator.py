# Image maps are those images on the web that have multiple hover points that link to different pages.
#Such images may include maps or splash pages.
#See if you can make one where the user specifies an image, clicks hotspots in the image and specify links.
#It will then generate the HTML code to a file that the user can then copy and paste into their website to make the image map.
