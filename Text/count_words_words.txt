We can’t from any point of view that history does 
not exist because everything has a past that help 
us to understand the present and enable us to 
understand the future, affirming that history is 
not denying the authenticity of the ancestors, their 
culture, teaching is to ignore our roots. We can’t deny 
that the story is told by humans who by nature are your 
views on the interpretation of events and perhaps a 
letter captured in the subjective of the facts and there 
we can say that history must always be subject to checks 
as possible. Fortunately there are many writings
by the same actors and even used gerogrifics drawings 
and writings as we can understand a bit subjective 
but what happened at that time. This is just one example.
