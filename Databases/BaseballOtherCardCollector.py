# Create an online application for keeping track of a collection of cards.
#Let the user enter all cards in a set, check off which ones they have, which ones they need and generate lists of cards they are looking for.
#For extra complexity, have it sum up sets and generate reports on how close they are of completing sets or the current value of a set.
